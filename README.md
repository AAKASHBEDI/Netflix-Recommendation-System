# Netflix-Recommendation-System

Netflix is a company that manages a large collection of TV shows and movies, streaming it anytime via online. This business is profitable because users make a monthly payment to access the platform. However, customers can cancel their subscriptions at any time.

Therefore, the company must keep the users hooked on the platform and not lose their interest. This is where recommendation systems start to play an important role, providing valuable suggestions to users is essential.

Netflix’s recommendation system helps them increase their popularity among service providers as they help increase number of items sold, offer a diverse selection of items, increase user satisfaction, as well as user loyalty to the company, and they are very helpful in getting a better understanding of what the user wants. Then it’s easier to get the user to make better decisions from a wide variety of movie products.

The idea behind the Netflix recommendation system is to recommend the most popular movies to users. They could be the most-watched, or also the ones with the highest ratings. The popularity of recommendations can be built based on usage data and article content.
